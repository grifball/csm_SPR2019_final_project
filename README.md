Computers, Sound, and Music - Spring 2019  
Final Project  
Professor: Bart Massey  
Instructor: Leila Hawana  
  
This project creates a song from a programming representation.  
Songs can have multiple tracks  
Tracks can have multiple sequential chords  
Chords can have independent lengths (time) and instruments  
All of this is represented by a string format

The makefile will give a list of options as the default option (just running `make`)  
You can also install python packages yourself and run a test with:  

    $ python3 ./scott_synth.py mus_files/clair_de_lune.mus ./clair_de_lune.wav
