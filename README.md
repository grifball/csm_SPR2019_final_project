Final Project  
Professor: Bart Massey  
Instructor: Leila Hawana  
  
This project creates a song from a programming representation.  
Songs can have multiple tracks  
Tracks can have multiple sequential chords  
Chords can have independent lengths (time) and instruments  
TODO: String representation of songs (loaded in through files)  
TODO: Drums  
  
The makefile will give a list of options as the default option (just running `make`)  
You can also install python packages yourself and run it with:  

    $ python3 ./scott_synth.py
